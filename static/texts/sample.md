## Basic Math Examples

Inline math: $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$

Displayed equation:

$$E = mc^2$$

A more complex equation with alignment:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}e^x &= e^x \\
\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) &= \frac{1}{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) &= \cos(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Theorem Example

**Theorem**: For any right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and hypotenuse $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

**Proof**: This is Pythagoras' theorem. The proof involves showing that the area of squares constructed on the two legs equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse.
